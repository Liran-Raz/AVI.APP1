# AVI.APP — Session Handoff (2026-07-24)

**You are continuing AVI.APP from a fresh chat.** Read this top-to-bottom first.
Deep detail lives in the auto-loaded memory (`project_avi_app.md`,
`feature_dev010_i18n.md`, `feature_dev013_2fa.md`, `feature_accessibility.md`,
`project_security_audit.md`) and in the git-tracked backlog
(`docs/DEV_TRACKING.md`) — this file is the fast "where we are + how to continue"
brief. **Load the `avi-app-architecture` skill before touching code.**

**⚠️ CURRENT BRANCH = `feat/dev-032-attachments-r1`** (NOT main). main is `c652cfe`
(DEV-031 Cloudflare edge hardening, live). The active work is **DEV-032 — the
encrypted file-attachments feature (R1a in progress)** — see the section directly
below. DEV-029 (security audit 2) is FULLY CLOSED; DEV-031 (Cloudflare proxy +
Full-strict + Bot Fight Mode + Page Shield) is LIVE. The stale docs PR #78 was
closed (branch kept).

## 🗄️ MOST RECENT / ACTIVE — DEV-032 file attachments + encryption (R1a in progress)

**Plan APPROVED (full detail):** `C:\Users\User\.claude\plans\breezy-munching-squid.md`
— read it first. Encrypted file storage on **clients / tasks / office-library**;
app-layer envelope encryption (master KEK in **AWS KMS il-central-1** → per-office
→ per-client → per-file DEK, AES-256-GCM); Supabase = system-of-record; feature
flag `STORAGE_UI` (off). Mockups approved (`.claude/design-preview/attachments-preview.html`
folder model + `task-files-preview.html`).

**Locked product decisions (do NOT re-litigate):**
- Attach targets = clients + tasks + office-library (NOT invoicing docs).
- Folder model: client 4 folders / office 5 (2 are aggregate views); task-with-client
  file → stored under the client (per-client key); task-without-client → office
  (per-office key). Full model in the plan + memory `project_avi_app.md`.
- **Max size 25MB** → R1 split: **R1a = Vercel core (≤4MB)**, **R1b = a Cloud Run
  media path lifts it to 25MB** (Vercel body cap ~4.5MB; encryption identical on
  Cloud Run — it's still our server). R2 = lifecycle (archive→delete, 7yr retention,
  30-day alert), R3 = encrypted Israel backup.
- **Task-file UI = Option A** (a "קבצים" section inside the task EDIT DIALOG, not a
  new task page).
- Storage-write auth = **Option A** (cookie-bound anon client writes ciphertext,
  storage.objects RLS by org-path — NO service-role key). `attachments` = hybrid
  (RLS SELECT + narrow archive-UPDATE, INSERT via `create_attachment` RPC).
  `encryption_keys` = fail-closed (0 policies, 0 grants, RPC-only). Crypto blobs =
  base64 TEXT (clean over PostgREST RPC).

**✅ DONE so far (committed on this branch):**
- **Migration `0031_attachments_and_encryption.sql`** — DRAFTED + **HARDENED** +
  **validated on real local Postgres 17** (applies clean, refuses non-postgres,
  idempotent, **postflight EXACT: `t|0|0|t|2|SELECT,UPDATE|1|6|1|6`**). `attachments`
  + `encryption_keys` tables, `tasks_id_org_uq`, **6 composite org-pin FKs**,
  immutability trigger, 6 SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (office/client key get+insert,
  revoke=crypto-shred, `create_attachment`). **Hardening pass (found while writing
  the attack tests, BEFORE any apply):** (a) org-pin FKs added on
  `attachments.key_id` and the self-referential `encryption_keys.wrapped_by_key_id`
  (composite count 4→6, postflight `|1|4|` → `|1|6|`); (b) the immutability trigger
  now ALSO freezes `uploaded_by`/`created_at`/`content_sha256`/`enc_algo`/
  `storage_provider` (provenance/integrity forgery closed); (c) `create_attachment`
  enforces key **scope/client coherence + liveness** — a client file can never ride
  the office key (it would survive that client's crypto-shred), and revoked keys are
  refused. **NOT applied to any real DB** — Liran applies it later after review
  (+ the separate **Storage bucket + storage.objects RLS operator runbook**, since
  storage schema is owned by supabase_storage_admin — likely a dashboard step).
- **`supabase/validation/0031_harness.sql`** — self-contained CI harness (adds tasks
  + profiles + clients_id_org_uq on a 0029-style base; 2 clients in org A).
- **`supabase/validation/0031_negative.sql`** — 64 behavioral attack/legit checks
  (M1-M10, K1-K8, W1-W11, X1-X9, S1-S7, D1-D4, L1-L9, H1-H3, R1-R3): key tables
  fail-closed even for the owner + anon; hybrid attachments posture (no direct
  INSERT/DELETE, UPDATE=archive-toggle only, immutability incl. smuggling);
  cross-org isolation via RLS filter + RPC membership + composite pins (23503);
  key coherence/liveness belts; owner-manager-only crypto-shred (nulls key, office
  key intact, re-mint allowed, dup-active 23505); deactivated-member lockout;
  routing/size CHECKs (23514). **ALL GREEN on local PG17.**
- **`validate-attachments` CI job** in `.github/workflows/db-migration-validation.yml`
  (mirrors `validate-write-hardening`): harness → refuse-non-postgres → apply →
  re-apply → **exact-postflight assert** → `0031_negative.sql`. **ALL 6 CI jobs green.**
- **Encryption modules (host-agnostic — run in Vercel AND Cloud Run; NO `server-only`).**
  `web/src/server/crypto/*`: `envelope.ts` (AES-256-GCM — generateKey/Dek,
  aesGcmEncrypt/Decrypt [12B iv + 16B tag, fresh iv/call], wrapKey/unwrapKey,
  sealToBlob/openBlob opaque office blob, base64 seam), `crypto-errors.ts`
  (CryptoAuthError/CryptoFormatError, leak-safe), `zeroize.ts`.
  `web/src/server/keys/*` (mirror `server/email/*`): `key-provider.ts` (master-KEK
  boundary iface, office key only), `local-key-provider.ts` (dev, `AVI_MASTER_KEK_B64`
  32B, fail-loud), `kms-key-provider.ts` (**owner-gated SKELETON** — selected but
  throws `KeyConfigError` until the `@aws-sdk/client-kms` dep + AWS land; intended
  impl documented, NO SDK import so build stays green), `key-provider.factory.ts`
  (runtime select, fail-loud STRICTER than email — no no-op: KMS→prod-without-KMS
  throws→local[dev/preview]→unconfigured throws), `key-store.ts` (persistence iface +
  `KeyRaceError`; concrete supabase impl = next layer), `key-hierarchy.ts`
  (office→client→DEK, per-request cache only + `dispose()` zeroize, race-safe).
  `env.ts` + `.env.local.example`: `AVI_KMS_MASTER_KEY_ARN`/`AVI_KMS_REGION`/
  `AVI_MASTER_KEK_B64`. **39 tests (real crypto): envelope round-trip {0,1,15,16,1KiB,
  1MiB} + tamper/wrong-key/iv-uniqueness + full office→client→DEK→file chain +
  crypto-shred; factory selection per env; hierarchy w/ fake KeyStore (create→cache,
  re-read across instances, race, DEK wrap/unwrap, dispose-zeroize).** Gate: **tsc 0 ·
  lint 0 · 661 tests (+39)**. NO new dependency (SDK behind the owner gate). Commit `b3af118`.

**🔜 NEXT (resume here, in order):**
1. **App layers** (mirror the invoicing `documents` vertical): the concrete
   `encryption-keys.repository.ts` (implements `KeyStore` over the definer RPCs) +
   `attachments.repository.ts` (Storage upload/download + aggregate queries) →
   `attachments.service.ts` (routing decision, orchestrates crypto+keys+storage+repo,
   capability gates, DTO mapping) → validator (`attachments.schema.ts`, size/MIME caps,
   filename sanitizer) → API routes → apiClient (add a **FormData primitive**) → UI
   (reusable Attachments component + client Tabs tab + task edit-dialog section
   [Option A] + `/storage` office-library page + nav + `nav.storage` i18n). Add
   `attachments.*` permissions + grants + parity tests. `storage.flags.ts`. Add
   413/415 to app-error. Hand-add `attachments` to `database.types.ts`.
2. R1b Cloud Run media path (25MB) — after R1a proven.

**Owner gates (each stop-and-confirm):** apply 0031 · Storage bucket + RLS runbook ·
AWS KMS setup + `@aws-sdk/client-kms` dep (~$1/key/mo; dev unblocked via
`AVI_MASTER_KEK_B64`) · Cloud Run (R1b). No service-role key.

## 🛡️ DEV-029 security audit 2 + write-hardening — FULLY CLOSED (9/9 live) · DEV-031 Cloudflare — LIVE
**DEV-031 (2026-07-23, config-only):** Cloudflare **proxy ON** (orange) on the 2
Vercel CNAMEs, mail records DNS-only; **SSL=Full (strict)** + **Bot Fight Mode** +
**Page Shield** + auto DDoS; verified (CF Tel-Aviv edge, all routes, CSP intact +
compatible with CF's same-origin JS-detection). Instantly reversible. main `c652cfe`.
Key verdicts (do not re-litigate): host-swap buys no security; the proxy is a
front-door shield not a DB guard; the data protection that matters is the app-layer
encryption (= DEV-032). Detail: DEV_TRACKING DEV-031 + memory.

**DEV-029 (2026-07-21):** LLM council said STAY on Supabase; a 4-agent red-team
audit found crown-jewel cross-tenant isolation SOLID (0 leak) + 9 findings (none
cross-tenant). All fixed across R1 (`0029` DB write-hardening) + R2 (app-layer) + R3
(`0030` org-pin + fail-closed rate-limiter + enforced CSP + `.strict()`), all LIVE;
**migration `0030` applied + verified in prod.** Detail below + memory
`project_security_audit.md`.

## 🛡️ MOST RECENT — DEV-029 security audit 2 + write-hardening (R1+R2 LIVE, R3 remains)
Prompted by Liran's "Supabase vs Google — which is safer?" fear. An **LLM council
said STAY on Supabase** (SaaS breaches are app-level, not vendor infra; Firebase
would add a 2nd isolation model + a browser DB SDK; the migration itself is the
risk). Then a **4-agent red-team code audit**: 🟢 **crown-jewel cross-tenant
isolation is SOLID (0 leak)**; 9 findings, **none cross-tenant** — 1 HIGH (#1
manager→owner via a direct PostgREST write; root cause = role checks lived only in
the Next service layer while tables kept permissive RLS + write grants to
`authenticated`) + Med/Low. Fixed in priority rounds (plan
`~/.claude/plans/jazzy-inventing-blanket.md`):
- **🟢 R2 (app-layer, [PR #104], main `9745aa3`, LIVE):** #3 open-redirect on
  `/login` (`sanitizeNextPath`, hardened to also block `\`, extracted to
  `web/src/lib/safe-path.ts`) + #6 CSV formula-injection in `reports.service.toCsv`
  (prefix `'` on text cells, with a numeric guard that keeps negative amounts real).
- **🟢🟢 R1 (DB write-hardening, migration `0029`, [PR #105], main `a342083`;
  APPLIED + VERIFIED IN PROD by Liran, postflight 3/4/0):** `SECURITY INVOKER`
  guard triggers with a `current_user='postgres'` bypass (precedent: 0027) that
  mirror `team.service` 1:1 → **ZERO app-code change**. Adds `guard_membership_write`
  + `revoke insert,delete` on memberships, `guard_invitation_role` (#4), split
  client_contacts policy (#5), `guard_client_active` + `revoke delete` on clients
  (#7), and swaps 12 deprecated-helper policies (#2). A **new permanent CI job
  `validate-write-hardening`** proves behaviorally on real Postgres that every
  direct-PostgREST attack is BLOCKED and legit owner/member writes PASS.
- **🟢 R3 MERGED + LIVE ([PR #106](https://github.com/Liran-Raz/AVI.APP1/pull/106)
  → main `1097aa6`, 2026-07-21; prod smoke green incl. LIVE proofs: enforced
  CSP header serving in its production variant, unknown-key body ⇒ 400
  "Unrecognized key", signin ⇒ 401 clean [not 503 ⇒ Upstash configured].
  **`0030` APPLIED + VERIFIED in prod the same evening — 9/9 + info DONE, the
  audit is fully exhausted**):** #8 rate-limiter
  fail-CLOSED in production (missing `UPSTASH_*` ⇒ typed 503; Preview stays
  fail-open by design; transient Redis errors stay fail-open — availability),
  #9 CSP Report-Only→**ENFORCED pragmatic** (connect-src blocks exfiltration +
  frame-ancestors/form-action/object-src/base-uri; script/style keep
  'unsafe-inline' — full nonce lockdown logged as **DEV-030**, P3; dev/preview
  branches for HMR/vercel.live never reach prod; live-verified 0 violations on
  all public pages incl. form-submit + lang toggle + a11y widget), `.strict()`
  on **46 input schemas** (unknown key ⇒ 400; deliberate exclusions with
  in-code comments: createTaskSchema legacy strip-contract, 5 fromEntries query
  schemas, path params; zero client↔schema mismatches), and **migration
  `0030_clients_handler_org_pin.sql`** (composite FK pins the client handler to
  a same-org membership; validated on real local PG17 8/8 + CI steps added to
  `validate-write-hardening`; NOT applied — Liran runs it, package in the PR).
  Gate: tsc 0 · lint 0 · **622 tests** (+55) · probes green. **After merge +
  apply: 9/9 findings + both info items closed — the audit is fully exhausted.**
- **Numbering:** security took `0029` + `0030`; the deferred attachments
  feature moves to `0031`. Full detail: memory `project_security_audit.md`
  (top section) + DEV_TRACKING DEV-029 + DEV-030.

## ⏳ MOST TIME-SENSITIVE — DEV-026 R5 email (check FIRST)
The ITA sandbox-portal approval email (for חשבוניות-ישראל R5): **as of the
2026-07-21 evening session it had NOT arrived** (Liran checked, incl. spam) —
past the expected 1–2 business days. **An escalation email to
ITAOpenApiSupport@taxes.gov.il (CC OpenAPI@taxes.gov.il) was drafted and handed
to Liran to send** from liran995@gmail.com. Next session: ask whether the
approval (or a support reply) arrived; when it lands, R5 is the next build
(see the DEV-026 R5 section below).

## 🟢 Accessibility (DEV-027 + DEV-028) — DONE + LIVE (statement + widget + ALL code-fixes)
Statement (PR #97/#99) + widget (PR #98) + the REAL code-fixes in **4 rounds
(PR #100–#103)** — ALL live in prod (main `61ade54`). Detail: memory
`feature_accessibility.md` + DEV_TRACKING DEV-027 detail.
- **DEV-027 accessibility statement** — `/accessibility` (he binding) + `/en`,
  footer link. **Re-worded to the standard Israeli template** (rail.co.il model
  Liran supplied): positive conformance + a GENERAL reservation, **NO specific
  gap list** (that was legally exposing) and **no false "fully compliant"**
  claim. Coordinator = Liran Raz / liran995@gmail.com / 050-8880981; operator
  עוסק מורשה 314954835.
- **DEV-028 accessibility widget** — floating navy button with a 9-adjustment
  menu (text-size/contrast/links/headings/font/spacing/stop-motion/cursor),
  real CSS via `<html data-a11y-*>`, no-flash `/public/a11y-init.js`. **Floating
  FAB on PUBLIC pages only; in-app it's Settings → נגישות tab** (Liran's call).
- **🟢 DONE (2026-07-19): the REAL a11y code-fixes — 4 rounds, all live in prod**
  (the strongest legal protection). **A** (PR #100) public auth forms:
  `autoComplete` + screen-reader-announced field-tied errors via a new shared
  `FormError` (`role="alert"` + `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby`, toast kept) +
  `<main>`/skip-link on all 6 auth pages. **B** (PR #101) `aria-hidden` on the
  landing's fake demo mockups (`.hero-demo-wrap` + 5 `.screen-stage`). **C**
  (PR #102) contrast `--ink-faint` `#67718a`→`#5e6880` (was 4.26:1 on the page
  bg, now 4.87:1; accent button white-on-`#2563eb` 5.17 untouched; approved via a
  before/after mockup). **D** (PR #103) same pattern on 8 in-app forms
  (profile/office/client/contact/task/role/onboarding/invite; done via 4 parallel
  agents + central verify). Each round: tsc/lint/560 tests/Vercel/prod-deploy
  green, Hebrew unchanged, no migration/deps. **Reusable:**
  `components/ui/form-error.tsx`.
- **Remaining (minor, deferred):** 🟡 consistent decorative-SVG `aria-hidden`;
  per-phrase `lang`; optional professional a11y audit. Statement + privacy/terms
  still merit an Israeli-counsel glance (non-blocking).

## 🟢🟢 DEV-010 i18n — ROUND 1 (Hebrew + English) COMPLETE — READ FIRST

**What it is:** full app-UI internationalization, 8 languages planned. **Round 1
(Hebrew + English) is DONE — the WHOLE app UI is bilingual and live in prod.**
Full detail + conventions: memory `feature_dev010_i18n.md`.

**DONE + LIVE in prod (main `ba207477`):** infra (self-hosted catalog, cookie-based
locale, NO next-intl, NO `[locale]` routing) + a language switcher with flags +
**every screen** translated he/en with correct LTR mirroring — settings, tasks,
clients, team+roles, dashboard, messages+notifications, invoicing, reports,
calendar, onboarding+invitations, the app-shell chrome, the in-app chrome
stragglers (topbar clock/connectivity, office-switcher, 2FA gate, bug-report),
AND the auth pages (login/signup/mfa/forgot/reset — unified onto the central
catalog, see PR-12). English is AVAILABLE in prod; Hebrew is the default so
existing users see zero change. Catalog **893 keys**; every PR: tsc/lint clean,
560 tests, no migration, no deps, Vercel green, QA'd + merged on Liran's word.
**Final `rg [֐-׿] web/src --glob '*.tsx'` sweep = CLEAN** (only deliberate Hebrew:
tax PDF `server/pdf`, legal `privacy`/`terms`+`/en`, marketing `LandingGlass`+
`marketing-lang` own i18n; plus code comments + the "א" brand glyph + intentional
language-name labels). NO accidental UI stragglers.

**KEY DECISIONS captured (for R2 + future work):** tax PDF / CSV / openformat
server-warnings / emails / DB-trigger notifications STAY Hebrew (guard-rail);
`formatAgorot(agorot, localeTag?)` defaults he-IL (server byte-identical);
reports UI translates from raw DTO codes; `nispach1.*` = 27 official doc-type
names byte-exact vs the server table; numeric `[direction:ltr]` columns use
`rtl:text-left ltr:text-right` (never `text-end`); server components (invite +
forgot/reset pages) translate via `getServerT(await readLocale())`; **auth
unification (PR-12): forms on the central `useT`, a new `AuthLangToggle` does
`apiClient.locale.set + router.refresh`, and the marketing-lang provider bridges
to the `avi-locale` cookie (inits from it + mirrors the toggle) so the landing
and auth stay in sync — landing→login is a full `<a>` nav so the fresh cookie is
read on load.**

**NEXT — R2 (the other 6 languages: ru/de/fr/ja/it/ar):** add
`messages/{ru,de,fr,ja,it,ar}.json` (the key set already exists — pure
translation) + extend `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` / `dirFor` (ar→rtl) /
`LOCALE_NATIVE_NAME` / `intlLocale` / `flag.tsx` + per-locale FONTS (Heebo covers
he+en; ru=Cyrillic, ja=CJK, ar=Arabic need Noto Sans/JP/Kufi) + native-speaker
review + Arabic RTL pass. Minor leftover cleanup: the PR-7 message read-by
chevron note. **R2 is PAUSED by Liran (2026-07-18) — staying on he+en for now**;
resume is his call.

**Conventions (critical):** each screen → its own branch/PR; delegate the string
extraction to a subagent with the established prompt BUT always self-verify after
(tsc + lint + 560 tests + `rg` no-leftover-Hebrew + spot-check en + confirm no
`common.*` key was reused whose Hebrew differs from the original — e.g. "ערוך"≠
common.edit "עריכה"). Hebrew values BYTE-IDENTICAL. `dir="ltr"` on email/phone/
tax-id fields stays. CSS physical→logical is ROLE-based. **Emails, DB-trigger
notification content, and tax PDFs stay Hebrew (guard-rail).**

## 🔐 DEV-013 (2FA/TOTP) — DONE + LIVE in prod (main `3d70d1c`)

Full TOTP two-factor: opt-in per user + owner-set HARD office-wide requirement +
15s auto-cancel on disable. Live but inert (opt-in; Hebrew default). Migration
`0028` applied. Recovery runbook: `docs/2FA_RECOVERY.md`. Detail: memory
`feature_dev013_2fa.md`.

## 🏛️ DEV-026 R5 (חשבוניות-ישראל) — WAITING on external approval

R1–R4 merged + live (invoicing/reports/open-format, flag off). **R5 (allocation
numbers via the gov gateway) is blocked on the ITA sandbox-portal approval** —
Liran registered (liran995@gmail.com), account "pending approval", email expected
~2026-07-19/20. When it lands: build R5 (OAuth client, allocation state machine,
₪10K→₪5K thresholds) against the sandbox. Owner reminders: cancel/credit the old QA
demo docs; add `SOFTWARE_PRODUCER_VATID=314954835` + `SOFTWARE_PRODUCER_NAME` to
Vercel before enabling invoicing in prod. Detail below + memory `project_avi_app.md`.

## 🔵 EARLIER ACTIVE WORK — DEV-026 invoicing module (הנהלת חשבונות)

**What it is:** a tax-compliant Invoices/Receipts + Reports module heading to
official **software registration** with the Israel Tax Authority ("תוכנה מוכרת").
Full plan approved by Liran 2026-07-16, based on the two official PDFs
(חוזר 24/2004 + מבנה-אחיד v1.31) + web verification. Multi-round R1→R7.
Plan file: `C:\Users\User\.claude\plans\hashed-herding-honey.md` (DEV-026 section).

**Shipped / in flight (2026-07-17):**
- **R1 (ledgers foundation) — MERGED to main** (PR #79 → `f96fc86`). Ledger-first
  model (`ledgers` = בית-עסק; self-ledger per org). **Migration `0027` APPLIED +
  VERIFIED in Production** (operator Liran, postflight PASS 10/10). Documents/lines/
  payments/counters(gap-free)/consents/vat_rates + immutability triggers + SECURITY
  DEFINER RPCs (issue/cancel/credit/deliver + role belt).
- **R2 (document lifecycle) — MERGED to main** (PR #81 → `308cf35`). Draft→issue
  (gap-free number, frozen snapshot, server totals) → cancel/credit. Full UI:
  list + wizard (305/320/400/330) + document view. `lib/money.ts` (agorot).
  **Liran's local QA PASSED** + 3 fixes (float-safe quantity, credit link, 330).
- **R3 (Hebrew PDF) — MERGED to main** (PR #82 → `00fa2f4`, deploy verified +
  smoke green). @react-pdf/renderer, Rubik OFL base64-embedded, מקור/העתק +
  print, first-original marks delivered. Storage deferred to R6.
- **R4 (reports + מבנה-אחיד export) — MERGED to main** (PR #83 → `00b8e94`).
  OPEN FORMAT v1.31 engine (`server/openformat/` — pure TS, field tables
  transcribed from the official spec read page-by-page; ISO-8859-8 logical via
  iconv-lite, signed fixed-width amounts, INI 1013=0, no B100/B110/M100,
  `OPENFRMT\<vat8>.<YY>\<MMDDhhmm>\` zip with inner BKMVDATA.zip per §2.2(ד);
  17 byte-exact tests) + reports layer (נספח-1 doc-type summary, sales book,
  receipts book, monthly VAT, client balances, CSV with BOM; 15 service tests)
  + `/reports` page + "דוחות" nav (mockup approved by Liran first).
  Permissions: reports.view/export = owner+manager; **openformat export =
  invoices.export = OWNER ONLY**. New deps: iconv-lite, jszip. No migration.
  513 tests. **SIMULATOR LOOP CLOSED (misim.gov.il, 2 rounds, 2026-07-17):**
  BKMVDATA/integrity/totals all PASS; round-1 found a real bug (field 1025
  must not be future → export now clamps the cut to the production day —
  fixed in `3bacc04`); the ONLY remaining INI item is 1006=00000000 (the
  registration number, closes at R7). The 2 general notes (min-2000-record
  registration sample; B110 absent) are by-design/R7 items. **Discovery:
  Liran is ALREADY a registered software house in מרשם התוכנות — "LIRAN AI
  תוכנות חכמות לעסקים ויחידים", no. 314954835.** Local env has
  SOFTWARE_PRODUCER_VATID/NAME; **add both to Vercel before enabling the
  module in prod.** Simulator upload how-to: charset = Windows ANSI
  ISO-8859-8-I; upload INI.TXT + BKMVDATA.TXT (extracted from the inner zip).
- **R4 production deploy COMPLETED 2026-07-17.** The 2026-07-16 GitHub incident
  ("Degraded REST API Availability", 22:21–23:50 UTC) had blocked Vercel from
  starting builds on the 3 main pushes; minutes after recovery `00b8e94` built
  **success** (23:55 UTC), then `9ed0321` (00:05) and the final retrigger
  `f32a87a` (2026-07-17) — prod now serves latest main. Full smoke green:
  `/api/health` 200 · `/login` 200 · `/tasks` 307 · `/api/ledgers` 401 ·
  `/api/reports/*` + openformat export 401 (the reports-401 flip = R4-live marker).
- **Prod state: code live but INERT** — `INVOICING_UI` flag OFF in Vercel (zero
  UI for real users). Liran QAs locally (`web/.env.local` has `INVOICING_UI=1`).
  Enable in prod = Vercel env vars (incl. the two SOFTWARE_PRODUCER_* ones) +
  Redeploy, Liran's call.

**NEXT = R5 חשבוניות-ישראל** (allocation numbers via the gov gateway: OAuth,
sandbox first; ₪10K threshold from 1.1.2026 → ₪5K from 1.6.2026). **R5 kickoff
2026-07-17:** full owner registration instructions delivered (the official
שע"ם OpenApiUserGuide read end-to-end + work-process deck + API-desc v2.0;
flow: personal ITA digital user → sandbox portal FIRST (mandatory precondition)
→ production-portal ORGANIZATION + signed docs from
gov.il/he/service/connect-to-shaam → approval email → Create App (CLIENT
ID+SECRET, secret shown ONCE) → Subscribe to the Invoices product).
**Liran registered on the sandbox portal (Fri 2026-07-17); account = "pending
approval"** — the "Multiple sign-ups using the same email" error on re-login is
the DOCUMENTED pending-state behavior (guide p.5). **Approval email expected
Sun–Mon 19–20.7** (1–2 business days over the IL weekend; check spam — portal
is IBM API Connect; escalate to ITAOpenApiSupport@taxes.gov.il if late).
Parallel owner action NOT blocked on that: prepare + submit the signed
production-org registration docs (the long-lead approval). Dev side: most of
R5 (state machine, thresholds, OAuth client, UI) can be built against mocks
before credentials — Liran's call. Then R6 signing+Storage, R7 registration
package (2000-record sample + real 1006 + submission).

**Housekeeping:** remind Liran to cancel/credit the leftover QA demo documents
(delivered ones can only be credited, not cancelled). Migration `0027` was taken
by DEV-026 → mobile DEV-025 M2 push moves to next-free. Open PR **#78** (mobile
docs) is from an earlier session — do NOT touch `docs/MOBILE_APP_TRACKING.md`
on the DEV-026 branches (conflict risk).

**Working rules reminder:** single git-owner at a time (one session touches git);
migrations are drafted by Claude as guarded packages, Liran runs them in the
Supabase SQL Editor (no DDL creds for Claude); local `next build` crashes are
environmental — Vercel CI is the build gate; ask before commit/push/merge;
zero Claude/Anthropic trace in the repo. Reply to Liran in Hebrew.

## 🎯 TL;DR

- **Product:** multi-tenant SaaS task-management for Israeli accounting offices
  (רואי חשבון). Hebrew RTL. ~300 client records of real financial data when live.
- **Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 +
  shadcn/ui · Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime + RLS) · Vercel.
- **Production:** **https://www.aviapp1.com** (Cloudflare→Vercel; old
  `avi-app-1.vercel.app` still alive). Auto-deploys on push to `main`.
- **`main` at `c75d0be`** (2026-07-21). Newest: **DEV-029 security audit FULLY
  CLOSED — 9/9 findings + info items live** (R1 `0029` + R2 app-layer + R3
  PR #106: fail-closed limiter / enforced CSP / .strict() / org-pin `0030`
  applied+verified; migrations in Prod now through **0030**, `0031` reserved
  for attachments; nonce-CSP logged as DEV-030 P3). Before that: **DEV-026
  invoicing R1–R4 merged + deployed, live-but-dormant** (flag off; R5 waits on
  the ITA sandbox approval — escalation email drafted, see the time-sensitive
  section). Earlier shipped:
  **Stage 12 (DEV-019)** + **Stage 13
  (DEV-020)** — clients-UX + task-flow bell notifications (mig `0021`), owner analytics
  **dashboard** + owner-granted **per-member dashboard access** (`0022`) + a new bilingual
  invite email + the **office chat** ("הודעות" — group + DMs, 3s polling, `0023`); then
  **DEV-021** (mobile nav drawer, PR #65) and **DEV-014** (soft-mute the in-app bell badge
  on task assignment, PR #68); **DEV-023** (mobile Web Push) logged to the backlog (PR #69);
  and **DEV-024 / Stage 14** — the WhatsApp-style chat upgrade: **R1** (conversation-model
  foundation, behavior-preserving, PR #71, mig `0024`) + **R2** (full group management —
  create/rename/add/remove/leave/delete, admin-only, PR #74, mig `0025`) + **R3+R4** (read
  receipts + unread badge + edit/delete ≤10 min, PR #76, mig `0026`). **Stage 14 DONE.**
  Migrations through `0026`. Adversarial multi-agent reviews gate each round (0 CRITICAL/HIGH
  on R2–R4). **⚠️ PR #76 also swept in DEV-025 M1 mobile work — concurrent-session incident,
  see below.** `git log -8` to confirm.
- **User = Liran**, Hebrew-speaking founder / product owner. Reply in Hebrew.
  He drives product; Claude drives implementation. Honest tradeoffs, not hype.
- **DEV-024 / Stage 14 COMPLETE (R1→R4) — live 2026-07-14** (R3+R4 = PR #76, main
  `9b0b041`, mig `0026`). WhatsApp-style chat: groups + read receipts + unread badge +
  edit/delete ≤10 min. Multi-user chat QA is Liran's in Prod.
- **⚠️ Concurrent-session incident (2026-07-14):** two Claude sessions shared ONE git
  working-tree/HEAD (this `D:\AVI.APP`); Session B's DEV-025 mobile work landed on Session
  A's branch, so **PR #76 squash-merged 146 files** (R3/R4 **+ all DEV-025 M1**: Capacitor +
  iOS project + native-bridge + native-OAuth deep-link + package-lock) to prod. Verified
  SAFE: prod healthy, native web-inert by design, web Google-OAuth path byte-unchanged
  (native branches gated on `isNativeApp()`). **LLM-council verdict: do NOT revert** (a
  146-file revert is the more dangerous act — deletes live R3/R4). **Decision: leave.** Open
  owner action: live OAuth verification in prod. **Prevention now in force: single git-owner
  at a time** (one session touches git, the other frozen); going forward use a separate
  `git worktree` per session. DEV-025 M1 foundation is therefore shipped-inert on prod.

## 📍 Where we are (everything below is LIVE in production + verified)

The email/domain/auth story, the "Liquid Glass" redesign, the full settings
screen, **Stage 12**, and **Stage 13** are all shipped. Recent arc (newest first):

- **DEV-014 — mute the in-app bell badge on task assignment (2026-07-12).** A
  per-user "פעמון בשיוך משימה" toggle beside the email toggle (Settings →
  התראות). **Soft mute (badge-only):** the assignment notification still shows
  in the bell list — it just no longer counts toward the red unread badge.
  Status-change bells (completion/return) always badge. **No migration** — a new
  `bellOnTaskAssignment` key in the existing `notification_prefs` jsonb;
  suppression is a read-layer filter on the unread COUNT only
  (`notifications.service.mutedBellTypes` → `countUnreadByUserId excludeTypes`),
  the DB triggers untouched, non-destructive. [PR #68]; tsc/lint/397 tests green.
- **DEV-021 — mobile navigation drawer (2026-07-12).** Navy-glass right-side
  drawer (full nav + account card + office switcher + logout) + a slim bottom bar
  (tasks · clients · messages + "תפריט"); desktop unchanged. `app-shell.tsx` only,
  no migration ([PR #65](https://github.com/Liran-Raz/AVI.APP1/pull/65), `aae0a05`).
- **DEV-020 — Stage 13 (2nd client-meeting requirements) COMPLETE (2026-07-12).**
  3 rounds. **Round 1** (PR #59/#60) — clicking a client row/card opens the client
  page; an "ערוך" button on client detail; migration `0021` (`notify_on_task_status_change`
  trigger — bell the CREATOR on completion + the ASSIGNEE on return-to-new, skip the
  actor); + live board refresh (3s cheap-signal poll `GET /api/tasks/version`) + faster
  bell. **Round 2 (R4)** (PR #61) — owner **analytics dashboard** (`/dashboard`: KPI
  cards + hand-rolled SVG/CSS charts from `tasks`, no dashboard migration) + **per-member
  dashboard access** the owner grants from the Team screen (migration `0022` =
  `organization_memberships.dashboard_access`; gate `canViewDashboard` = owner || flag;
  non-authorized member → friendly "no access" screen, not 404) + a new **bilingual
  EN+HE invite email**. **Round 3 (R5)** (PR #62) — **office chat** under `/messages`:
  office-group feed + 1:1 DMs, 3s polling (paused when hidden), migration `0023`
  (`messages` table, immutable, RLS via `user_is_active_member_of`) + the mobile bottom
  nav made horizontally scrollable so icons keep a normal size. **A pre-merge adversarial
  multi-agent security review of R5 found 0 security issues but caught 6 correctness bugs
  the mocked tests missed (incl. a timestamp-format bug that silently killed live
  delivery) — all fixed before merge.** 384 tests; each Vercel deploy verified + prod
  smoke green. Cross-user chat QA is Liran's, in Production.
- **DEV-019 — Stage 12 (client-meeting requirements) COMPLETE (2026-07-11).**
  Migration `0020` (per-org task numbers + `task_counters` + SECURITY-DEFINER
  assign trigger, `due_at` nullable, `received`→`new` + assigned→creator remaps,
  `clients.handling_user_id`) applied + verified in Prod. **Round A** (PR #54) —
  topbar DB/internet indicators + clock. **Round B+C** (PR #55) — task form
  (optional due date behind a checkbox, no status field, mandatory assignee
  default=creator, `#0001` + created stamp, "סופני"→"עתידי") + **personal board**
  3 cols חדשות/במעקב/הושלמו via a repo `.or()` (a done task returns to its
  CREATOR; employee sees only their board, owner/admin get a "הלוח של: X"
  selector gated on `session.activeRole`). **Round D** (PR #56) — client
  "גורם מטפל" picker + table column/mobile row/detail cell + F1-style same-org
  guard. **QA follow-up** (PR #57) — "החזר לחדשות" on in-progress cards. 347
  tests; each Vercel deploy verified + prod GET smoke green.
- **DEV-017** — enabled Google OAuth in Production, config-only (zero code changed).
  Code was audited link-by-link first (button → apiClient → route → service → adapter
  → `/auth/callback`, including the new-user path landing on `/onboarding`). Liran did
  Google Cloud (OAuth consent screen In production + client with the exact Supabase
  redirect URI) + Supabase (provider enabled, Client ID/Secret verified byte-for-byte
  against the downloaded Google JSON). Live-tested with an existing user (landed on
  `/tasks`); new-user path code-verified only (shares the same onboarding gate as
  regular signup) — no spare Google account to test live.
- **DEV-018** (PR #53, `36b725d`) — fixed 2 regressions in Settings→התראות:
  (a) toggle "reset" (Radix Tabs unmounts inactive content → lifted prefs state
  up to `SettingsPage`; form is now controlled); (b) RTL switch thumb overflow
  (`ui/switch.tsx` → direction-scoped `ltr:/rtl:` translate). DOM-verified.
- **DEV-009** — full `/settings` screen (fixed the broken nav 404). **4 tabs:**
  פרופיל (edit name/phone), אבטחה (change password WITH current-password
  re-auth), משרד (owner edits office; org_code copy-only), התראות (email-on-
  assignment toggle). Part 1 PR #51 (no migration — RLS self-update policies
  already existed). Part 2 PR #52 + **migration `0019_notification_prefs.sql`
  (applied+verified in Prod by Liran)**. Email gated in
  `tasks.service.sendAssignmentEmailIfNeeded`.
- **DEV-008** (PR #49, PR #48/#47 for marketing) — "Liquid Glass" **Calm**
  redesign of the internal dashboard (navy glass sidebar, frosted sticky topbar,
  near-opaque content cards) + **mobile-responsive fix** (Team/Clients were wide
  tables clipped on mobile → dual layout: table on `md+`, stacked cards below).
  All CSS isolation preserved; no color token changed.
- **DEV-004/005/006/007** — domain `aviapp1.com` + Resend (all app + Auth mail
  sends from `aviapp1.com`), reset-password PKCE fix, Custom SMTP, same-password
  indicator. All Production-verified.

**Migrations applied to Production: through `0026`** (0001–0026; `0023` chat `messages` ·
`0024` chat conversation model — DEV-024 R1, fail-closed RPC-only + backfill · `0025`
group-management RPCs — DEV-024 R2 · `0026` read-receipts (`mark_conversation_read` +
`get_unread_counts`) + edit-policy membership hardening — DEV-024 R3+R4, applied+verified
before merge). `0025`/`0026` are additive; the R3+R4 code is in a PR pending merge.
Legacy `role` enum (owner/admin/employee) + `ROLE_GRANTS` are still the SOLE
authority; the custom-roles infra (0011–0017) is live but 100% DORMANT (Liran
chose to stop — DEV-001/003).

---

## 🔜 What's next — backlog (all optional; `docs/DEV_TRACKING.md` is source of truth)

Nothing is blocked. Pick from the backlog when Liran wants:

- **DEV-013 (2FA/TOTP) — 🟢 MERGED + LIVE 2026-07-17** ([PR #84](https://github.com/Liran-Raz/AVI.APP1/pull/84) → main `3d70d1c`).
  TOTP two-factor: opt-in per user + owner-set **hard** office-wide requirement
  (a member who hasn't enrolled reaches only Settings until they do). Disable
  dialog auto-cancels after 15s (safe default). Architecture chain preserved;
  `requireSession`→`MFA_REQUIRED` gate; `/mfa` challenge page (covers Google
  OAuth + password recovery without touching middleware). **Live but INERT** —
  no feature flag, but opt-in: `require_mfa` defaults false and nobody's enrolled,
  so nothing changes until a user enables it / an owner turns on the office
  requirement. All 3 owner gates DONE: TOTP enabled in Supabase, migration `0028`
  (`organizations.require_mfa`) applied+verified in Prod, Liran's QA passed
  ("עובד טוב"). Also fixed a latent app-wide bug — `<Toaster/>` was never mounted
  so every `toast()` was a silent no-op (now live). No new deps. Recovery runbook:
  `docs/2FA_RECOVERY.md` (lost device → cloud-sync authenticator restores; else
  Liran removes the factor in Supabase Dashboard). 556 tests.
- **DEV-010→016 (P3 nice-to-haves, added 2026-07-11):** EN form-field labels
  (010) · client testimonial block (011, needs a real quote) · office logo+ח.פ.
  (012, needs migration + Storage) · ~~2FA (013)~~ **CODE COMPLETE — PR #84, see above** ·
  ~~mute in-app bell (014)~~ **DONE 2026-07-12 (PR #68 — soft mute, no migration)** ·
  staging env (015) · landing `<noscript>` (016).
- **DEV-023 (Web Push) + DEV-022 (realtime) — logged, deferred (2026-07-12):**
  DEV-023 mobile Web Push notifications (PR #69 — needs a service worker + VAPID +
  a `push_subscriptions` migration + server-side send; iOS works only for an installed
  home-screen PWA). DEV-022 realtime via Supabase Realtime (LLM-council vetted, Firebase
  rejected; trigger = heavy chat use / customer ask / scale).
- **DEV-001 / DEV-003 (deferred by Liran):** the custom-roles activation +
  authoritative cutover. Infra is live but dormant; the existing 3-tier
  Owner/Manager/Employee system already meets the client's need.

**DEV-020 (Stage 13) DONE 2026-07-12; DEV-019 (Stage 12) + DEV-017 (Google OAuth)
DONE 2026-07-11** — see above. Highest value left: **DEV-013** (2FA, financial
data) or **DEV-015** (staging — would've saved the deploy pain below).

## 🚦 The one architecture rule (never bypass)

```
Frontend (client component) → apiClient (lib/api-client.ts) → API Route
  → Service (server/services) → Repository (server/repositories) → Supabase
```

Critical do-nots:
- ❌ No `@supabase/*` imports or `supabase.from/rpc/auth` in client components.
  Client talks to `apiClient` only.
- ❌ No `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (not stored, not used — intentional).
- ❌ No migration changes without explicit approval. Migrations apply MANUALLY
  (Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor, as role `postgres`) — no CI/CLI automation.
- ❌ No tokens/raw session in API responses — small DTOs only.
- ❌ Don't touch `src/proxy.ts` / `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` casually.
- ✅ **Before touching `web/src`, load the `avi-app-architecture` skill.**

---

## ⚙️ Operating model (how this project actually runs)

- **ZERO Claude/Anthropic trace** anywhere — code, commits, PR bodies. **NO
  `Co-Authored-By` trailer, no "Generated with Claude".** (This overrides the
  harness default. The old handoff's Co-Authored-By instruction was WRONG.)
- **Ask before commit/push.** Liran approves each merge explicitly ("תמזג / יש
  אישור"). When authorized, Claude merges via `gh pr merge <n> --squash
  --delete-branch`. `gh` IS authenticated on this machine.
- **Migrations = operator-assisted:** Claude drafts the SQL (guarded: role
  `postgres` + single-apply + `notify pgrst`), Liran runs it in the Supabase
  Dashboard and returns the verification output, Claude reviews. **Claude has NO
  Prod DDL access** (anon key can't DDL; no service key). Never request secrets.
- **Claude cannot log into the app** (auth-gated) → authenticated-screen QA is
  Liran's. Verify what you can headlessly (build, unauth GET codes, DOM
  measurement of components), hand the rest to Liran with a precise checklist.
- **`docs/DEV_TRACKING.md`** is the git-tracked backlog + source of truth for
  priorities — update it on every change (table row + detail + changelog).
- Work in a branch (`feat/…` / `fix/…`), run `tsc + lint + build` green before
  commit, open a PR, hand to Liran to merge (or merge on his explicit word).

---

## 💡 Reusable lessons (learned the hard way this session)

- **NEVER run two Claude sessions on the same git working-tree at once.** Two sessions
  share ONE HEAD + index; each other's commits accumulate on the shared branch, so one
  session's squash-merge silently bundles the other's work (this bit us — PR #76 shipped
  146 files, R3/R4 + all of DEV-025 M1, to prod). Explicit `git add` does NOT protect you —
  the collision is at the branch/HEAD level, not staging. Fixes: (1) **single git-owner at a
  time** — one session does all git ops, the other stays fully frozen (read-only) until
  handed ownership; (2) durably, **one `git worktree` (or clone) + branch per session** so
  each has its own HEAD. Before any commit, `git status` + `git diff --cached --name-only`
  and sanity-check the file COUNT/scope vs the PR's intent.
- **Vercel transient build failures:** a deploy can fail at the git-clone/setup
  stage with "unexpected error… try rebuilding" — that's Vercel infra, NOT the
  code. If local `next build` + all GitHub CI checks are green, just RETRIGGER
  (push an empty commit `--allow-empty`, or Redeploy). Don't hunt the code.
- **Radix Tabs unmount inactive `TabsContent`** → any auto-saving control inside
  a tab must keep its state ABOVE the `Tabs` (lift to the page component), not in
  form-local `useState`, or it "resets" on tab switch.
- **RTL toggles/switches:** `translate-x` is PHYSICAL, and the thumb's off
  position is direction-dependent (right in RTL). Direction-scope the on
  transform (`ltr:` / `rtl:`), don't just negate.
- **RLS was pre-provisioned for settings:** `"users update own profile"` (0009)
  and `"owner can update own org"` (0003/0009) already exist — profile/office
  self-edit needs NO migration, only the app-layer write stack.
- **Every push to `main` triggers a Prod deploy** — even doc-only commits (they
  rebuild; harmless, but be aware).
- **Retiring an enum/status value** (Stage 12 dropped `received` from the flow):
  keep it in the DB enum AND the validator — just stop PRODUCING it (UI +
  `nextStatus`). Removing it from `TaskStatus`/label maps forces coupled type
  churn; leaving it as defensive-render-only is clean.
- **Personal-board scoping is a repository `.or()` predicate** (assignee's
  new/in_progress OR creator's done), NOT a status filter. And "view another's
  board" / client-handler guards gate on the ENUM `session.activeRole`
  (relational, cutover-safe), never a grantable permission key — so they survive
  a future DB-authoritative roles cutover.
- **A `SECURITY DEFINER` trigger owned by `postgres` writes a locked-down table**
  (`task_counters`: RLS on, 0 policies, all client grants revoked) — the per-org
  counter is untouchable by any client role, yet task inserts allocate `#NNNN`
  atomically. Trigger firing does NOT need EXECUTE grants.
- **Repo-mocked unit tests give FALSE confidence on client↔DB serialization +
  client polling logic.** R5's chat shipped 8 green tests, but an adversarial
  multi-agent review over the REAL wire format caught 6 bugs — the worst:
  `z.string().datetime()` REJECTS a Postgres `timestamptz` (PostgREST serializes
  `+00:00`, never a bare `Z`) → every chat poll 400'd → live delivery was silently
  DEAD. **Use `.datetime({ offset: true })` for any DB-timestamp round-trip** (as
  `roles.schema.ts` already does) and add a real VALIDATOR test, not just a
  repo-mocked service test.
- **Per-conversation polling** needs a `cancelled` flag inside ONE effect keyed on
  the conversation (else a stale switch-response renders into the wrong thread +
  clobbers the cursor); the delta cursor uses **`gte` + client id-dedup** (not
  `gt`, or same-timestamp messages drop); optimistic-send must NOT advance the cursor.
- **An adversarial pre-merge review pays for itself** on anything with RLS / a new
  client-facing table / real-time-ish behavior — it caught what a green test suite
  could not. Worth running before merging a security- or correctness-sensitive feature.
